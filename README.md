# 42-ft_printf
  
  Goal of this project is to recreate function Printf from the standar C library while still within the standards of the [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf).
  Goal is to cover:
  * c - Character Flag
  * s - String Flag
  * d - Signed Decimal Integer Flag
  * i - Integer Flag
  *	u - Unsigned Decimal Integer Flag
  *	p - Pointer Address Flag
  *	x - Lowercase Hexadecimal Flag
  *	X - Uppercase Flag
  * % - Print percentage sign after double %%
 
 In this project I have learned about [Variadic arguments](https://linux.die.net/man/3/va_arg) and how to use them.
